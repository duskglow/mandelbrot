# Mandelbrot Viewer Development Transcript

This document records the key steps, design decisions, and debugging process for the Mandelbrot Viewer demo application, as discussed with GitHub Copilot.

---

## Project Initialization
- Created an Express.js project with security best practices (Helmet middleware).
- Set up static file serving for the frontend.
- Established project structure: `public/`, `public/js/`, `.github/`, `.vscode/`.
- Added `README.md` and `copilot-instructions.md` to document requirements and coding standards.

## Frontend Implementation
- Designed the UI with a canvas for Mandelbrot rendering and a left-side control panel for user input.
- Implemented all JavaScript logic in separate `.js` files (`mandelbrot.js`, `panel.js`).
- Added controls for zoom, center coordinates, max iterations, color gradient selection, and a reset button.
- Supported 10 color gradients for Mandelbrot visualization.

## Mandelbrot Rendering Logic
- Used async/await for all asynchronous code.
- Implemented Mandelbrot set rendering in `mandelbrot.js`.
- Added mouse wheel/trackpad zoom and drag-to-pan support.
- Used a `pendingParams` object as the single source of truth for view state.
- Ensured only the latest render updates the UI, using a render ID system to prevent race conditions.
- Added abort logic to cancel in-progress renders on new zoom events.
- Added detailed debug logging for mouse wheel and render functions to diagnose zoom issues.

## Zoom and Performance Improvements
- Initially implemented open-ended zoom, but encountered race conditions and UI jumps during rapid zooming.
- Added a render ID system and debounced zoom rendering to ensure only the latest render updates the UI.
- Switched from debouncing to throttling for mouse wheel zoom events to improve responsiveness.
- Tuned the throttle interval to 10ms for smooth, real-time zooming.

## Debugging and Finalization
- Used debug logs to confirm that the zoom "jump" issue was resolved and that only the latest render updates the UI.
- Confirmed that the application is robust, responsive, and suitable for demo purposes.

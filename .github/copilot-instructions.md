- All JavaScript logic must be in separate .js files (no inline JS in HTML).
- Use async/await for all asynchronous code, avoid callbacks unless absolutely necessary.
- No user-facing API, but internal APIs are allowed.
- No authentication required, but follow Node.js security and coding best practices.
- The frontend consists of a canvas covering most of the screen and a vertical control panel on the left.
